:description: A minimal language to describe interactive, terminal-based text adventure games

I'm in the process of decoupling PyChemin from its inception's repository, https://github.com/ewen-lbh/hyperis[Hyperis] -- a terminal-based adventure game.

A proper README + GitHub page will soon be available.

In the meantime, if you can read french, you can https://ewen-lbh.github.io/hyperis[learn PyChemin's syntax]
