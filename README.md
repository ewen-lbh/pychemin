# PyChemin

I'm in the process of decoupling PyChemin from its inception's repository, [Hyperis](github.com/ewen-lbh/hyperis) -- a terminal-based adventure game.

A proper README + GitHub page will soon be available.

In the meantime, if you can read french, you can [learn PyChemin's syntax](ewen-lbh.github.io/hyperis)
