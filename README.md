# PyChemin
[![pip install pychemin](https://img.shields.io/badge/pip%20install-pychemin-blue)](https://pypi.org/project/pychemin)

I'm in the process of decoupling PyChemin from its inception's repository, [Hyperis](github.com/ewen-lbh/hyperis) -- a terminal-based adventure game.

A proper README + GitHub page will soon be available.

In the meantime, if you can read french, you can [learn PyChemin's syntax](https://ewen-lbh.github.io/hyperis)

I created a [vscode extension for PyChemin](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/vscode-pychemin)
